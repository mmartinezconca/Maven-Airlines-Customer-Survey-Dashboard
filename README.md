## **Project Background**
As a Senior Data Analyst for Maven Airlines, a fictional US-based airline headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, I was tasked with analyzing the latest passenger satisfaction survey and identify what factors caused the satisfaction rate to drop below 50%, an all-time low. This report uses the resulting survey ratings on various airline services (e.g., Cleanliness, In-flight Wifi) from over 129k passengers using a scale ranging from 1 to 5, as well as basic passenger demographic information (eg., Age and Gender) and basic flight metrics such as flight distance, and arrival and departure delay in minutes. The goal was to find key areas were passenger satisfaction is lagging and provide practical, data-driven recommendations that can increase the airline's satisfaction rate.

## **Executive Summary**
This analysis provides a general overview of Maven Airlines' customer satisfaction rate across customer demographic and rating of airline services that were obtained from the 2022 Customer Satisfication Survey.  

## **Insights Deep-Dive**
* **High-level Analysis**
  * The airline has an overall customer satisfaction rate of only **43%**.
  * Over 129k passengers (49% Males, 50% Females) participated in the survey.
  * **Business** is the most common class (48%), closely followed by **Economy** (45%).
  * Most Passengers in the survey are in the **31-59** age group (59%).
  * **Short-haul flights** (defined as under 1,500 miles) is the most frequently occuring flight distance group.
  * The overwhelming majority of flights hvae **No Delay** (defined as being 15 minutes or less than the scheduled departure/arrival time).
 
* **Likert Analysis:**
  * The three services that passengers were most dissatisfied with were, in descending order:
    1. **Gate Location**,
    2. **Ease of Online Booking**, and
    3. **In-flight Wifi**

## **Recommendations** 
Based on these findings, I would give the following recommendations to the releavnt departments:
* **Improve in-flight Wifi by upgrading internet badwidth and speed, and transition airline fleet from air-to-ground to satellite**
* **Redesign the booking website that follows good user experience (UX) practices**
* **Leverage Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to strategically assign gate locations**
