## **Project Background**
As a Senior Data Analyst for Maven Airlines, a fictional US-based airline headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, I was tasked with analyzing the latest passenger satisfaction survey and identify what factors caused the satisfaction rate to drop below 50%, an all-time low. This report uses the resulting survey ratings on various airline services (e.g., Cleanliness, In-flight Wifi) from over 129k passengers using a scale ranging from 1 to 5, as well as basic passenger demographic information (eg., Age and Gender) and basic flight metrics such as flight distance, and arrival and departure delay in minutes. The goal was to find key areas were passenger satisfaction is lagging and provide practical, data-driven recommendations that can increase the airline's satisfaction rate.
